        <h3>Linn Fritz</h3>
        <h4>Swedish illustrator, designer and animator Linn Fritz lives and works in London where she creates charmingly <br>
            clean, precise imagery in a trademark pastel palette for a wide range of editorial and commercial clients. <br>
            Her neat, fluid line work was honed during her time at Hyper Island, a time which Linn cites as <br>
            “hands down one of the best experiences” of her life. “My Hyper Island journey completely changed me <br> 
            as a person.”she says, “It pushed me to work harder and gave me the tools to succeed in the real world.” <br>
            The progressive nature of Hyper Island led Linn to abandon pen and paper and concentrate on what digital could <br>
            offer her already well-honed drawings. As she puts it, “There's more freedom drawing digitally, and more room <br>
            for mistakes.” Alongside her editorial and commercial projects, Linn is the co-founder of Panimation, <br>
            “a community of equality-driven women, trans and non-binary friends aiming to connect and support each other <br>
            within the animation industry.” Some of her favorite projects often orbit around her interests of <br>
            “feminism, clothes, plants and interior” but Linn also looks for a good client relationship, <br>
            one with trust and creative freedom.</h4>
