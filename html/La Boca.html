        <h3>La Boca</h3>
        <h4>The portfolio of LA-based illustrator Xoana Herrera is an explosion of sumptuous, <br>
            stylish character scenes dwelling in a world that, frankly, looks ideal. <br>
            Xoana trained as a graphic designer in Argentina but over time found herself <br>
            drawn to the world of illustration after a five-year stint at Buck agency. <br>
            Now, alongside founding a feminist creative collective,Get it Girl, she creates graceful, <br> 
            complex and accessible imagery which would be as at home in an ad campaign <br>
            as it would be in a children’s book (which she's quite keen to try soon). <br>
            “As an artist I think it is up to us to keep evolving and taking creative decisions,” she says. <br> 
            “Aiming to be innovative is something I feel I can dare to try every time I take a job, and that’s amazing.” </h4>
