        <h3>Camillo Huinca</h3>
        <h4>Camilo Huinca's work is rich with colour, content and a brightly illustrated narrative that speaks for itself. <br>
            Born and raised in Santiago in Chile, Camilo has divided his career between graphic design and painting. <br>
            Working independently has allowed Camilo to “develop (his) own style, having a main focus on the use of curiosity,” <br> 
            he explains. In 2014 Camilo set up Perfe Studio where he concentrates on graphic design projects in “a more commercial way”. <br> 
            However, within illustration, he described his main motivation as, “to be able to generate a communication method <br>
            based on simplicity and synthesis, with few tools and colours.”  I am interested in identifying people’s behaviour, <br>
            portraying activities, intimate moments, body gestures, disfiguring objects and reducing the amount of detail <br>
            in a composition.” Camilo is fascinated by everyday scenes, moments and personal habits, often depicting scenic bus routes, <br>
            art galleries and public figures in his own psychedelically shaped style. “Within my work I try to reproduce real moments <br>
            from an innocent and impartial perspective.”</h4>
