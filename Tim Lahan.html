        <h3>Tim Lahan</h3>
        <h4>San Francisco-based artist Tim Lahan’s naughty, witty artwork is the product of his ability <br>
            to digest and illustrate clever glitches, concepts and interesting visual cues from the world around him. <br>
            “I generally aim to make things as simple as possible,” says Tim. “Sometimes they come out funny.” <br>
            Generally commissioned to bring a touch of joy to magazines, brand campaigns and music collateral, <br>
            the ADC Young Gun award winner’s instantly recognisable style is enviably simple and genuinely funny: <br>
            something very few illustrators can boast.</h4>
